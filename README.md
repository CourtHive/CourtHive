# Why CourtHive

CourtHive is an Open Source / Open Data initiative to develop components to support the emergence of a standards based ecosystem of services for competition.  It began when a parent's desire to participate in Tennis Player Development ran headlong into poor quality data, poor IT investments on the part of governing bodies, and the reality that the dynamics of a fragmented market are such that there is very little collaboration or integration between technology providers.  A focus on [Data Visualization](http://tennisvisuals.com/) morphed into an obsession with the production of [good quality data](https://courthive.medium.com/toss-tennis-open-software-standards) and led to the development of a document-based tournament management platform which has ultimately influenced the emergence of the ITF's [Tennis Open Data Standards](https://itftennis.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TODS/overview).

Though the focus here is üéæ Tennis, the underlying data structures and tournament management capabilities enabled by these data structures are applicable to any sport which uses draw structures / brackets ‚öΩ üèÄ ‚õ≥ üèÖ.


## üé∏ Current Focus

[Competition Factory](https://courthive.github.io/tods-competition-factory/) is a collection of state engines and associated utilities which comprise all of the business rules necessary to generate and manage tournaments with events/draws/brackets of arbitrary complexity.  The [Competition Factory](https://courthive.github.io/tods-competition-factory/) is deployed in production in both the [USTA](https://tournamentdesk.usta.com/) and [ITA](https://tournamentdesk.wearecollegetennis.com/login) Tournament Desk platforms.

[Score Grid](https://courthive.github.io/tods-score-grid/) is a React project to visualize the draw structures produced by the [Competition Factory](https://courthive.github.io/tods-competition-factory/). I am learning [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) and [Radix-UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/). This project is a second iteration of [React Draws](https://courthive.github.io/tods-react-draws/example)
